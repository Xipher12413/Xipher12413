Hello! 👋 I'm Tejas, a passionate developer with expertise in JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and PowerShell. My enthusiasm for coding is fueled by a love for all things tech. 💻

Beyond the screen, I'm a cat person 🐱 who loves being around animals. I enjoy nature 🌿, the sound of rain 🌧️, and the calm of the night 🌙.

I'm a huge Potterhead ⚡️ and a devoted anime fan 🎌. Some of my favorite series include One Piece 🏴‍☠️ and Demon Slayer 🗡️.

I'm here on GitHub to collaborate on impactful projects and to continually grow my skills. Let's create something amazing together! 🚀✨<br>
✨ Until then, <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Killing_Curse" target="_blank">AvAaDA KEdaVRA! </a>
