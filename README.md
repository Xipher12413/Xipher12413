👋 Hi there! I'm an avid tech enthusiast diving deep into the realms of coding and creativity. With a passion for crafting digital experiences, I'm always exploring the latest in web development and technology.

🌱 My interests lie in programming, technology, and anything horror in particular. When I'm not absorbed in lines of code, you'll find me out in nature, surrounded by animals (total cat person 🐱).

⚡️ Proud Potterhead and anime lover, I enjoy immersing myself in the magical worlds of Hogwarts and the captivating stories of anime.

✨ Let's connect and collaborate on some amazing projects!
✨ Until then, <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Killing_Curse" target="_blank">AvAaDA KEdaVRA! </a>
